- Builds can be found here: http://jenkins.jselby.net/job/Cubition-Launcher/

The Cubition Launcher is a client-side JavaFX+HTML powered launcher that helps automate logging in, and Bootstrapping.

Currently, it loads a Bootstrap(css) HTML page with a few elements scattered around, and a test loading animation.
